# Security: Row- & Column-Level Security (RLS/CLS)

Row/column security is **never silently dropped and never silently ported** — and it is handled by the **skill**, not baked into the converted model. The converter (`convert_tableau_to_sigma`) only **detects and reports** security in `result.security[]`; it does **not** inject it into the data-model spec (a stateless converter can't create Sigma user attributes or assign members, so an injected `CurrentUserAttributeText` filter would fail-closed to 0 rows). This skill provisions + applies it after the model is posted.

**What is detected for Tableau:** calculated fields using `USERNAME()`/`ISMEMBEROF('group')`/`USERATTRIBUTE('attr')` (translated to `CurrentUserEmail()` / `CurrentUserInTeam("group")` / `CurrentUserAttributeText("attr")`). Cross-element (dim-attribute) RLS is reported with a warning to apply on the owning element/derived view.

**Flow (only runs when `result.security` is non-empty — zero overhead otherwise):**
1. **Convert + post** the data model as usual. Capture the `dataModelId` and the converter's `result.security[]` (write it to `security.json`).
2. **Gate (opt-in/out, default _Port_).** Show a plain-English summary of each detected rule + recommended Sigma mapping, then ask: **Port** (recommended) / **Customize** (review per-rule attribute/team mapping + username-to-email reconciliation) / **Skip** (migrated model shows ALL rows to everyone). Reuse-first: existing Sigma user attributes/teams are matched before creating new ones.
3. **Provision + apply** with the shared engine:
   ```bash
   python scripts/get_token.py --workdir <WORK>   # shell-neutral; writes <WORK>/auth.json (read automatically)
   python3 scripts/apply_sigma_rls.py --from-security security.json --dm-id <dataModelId>            # plan only (default)
   python3 scripts/apply_sigma_rls.py --from-security security.json --dm-id <dataModelId> --provision --apply
   ```
   `--provision` creates missing user attributes / teams; `--apply` PATCHes the boolean RLS calc column + fail-closed `filters` entry and the `columnSecurities` (CLS) onto the matching element.
4. **Assign membership.** Assign per-user attribute values / team membership from the source tool's group/role membership (the converter reports the attribute/team names; the values come from the source's user mapping).

**Skip is loud:** opting out leaves the migrated model with NO RLS — all rows visible to everyone. Confirm before skipping.
